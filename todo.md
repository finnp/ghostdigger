# ghost digger

## todo
* ii  start screen
* iii winning condition?? (find all gold, show how much gold is around)
* iii pausable

## done

i mostly reworked the structure a bit. i basically moved everything in the game itself,
which made it easier to add a restart mode. so after 5 seconds of game over, it 
automagically restarts now.

## possible features
* rooms for ghosts (?)
* light/ghost visibility (?)
* hp for player (?)
* use of gold
* reveal gold (?)
* mining takes longer (?)
* powerups (?)
* improve movement
* pause game
